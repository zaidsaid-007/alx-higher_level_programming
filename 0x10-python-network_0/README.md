Web Development Fundamentals with cURL and Python

This project focuses on building a strong understanding of core web development concepts like URLs, HTTP, and cURL. 

**Learning Objectives:**

By following these resources and completing the tasks, you'll be able to:

- Explain fundamental web concepts like URLs, HTTP requests and responses, and cookies.
- Read and dissect the components of a URL.
- Utilize cURL to make HTTP requests.
- Simulate the process of browsing a website in your terminal.

**Resources:**

- **Read or watch:** Learn about HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) excluding specific methods like TRACE, CONNECT, and functionalities like Language Negotiation and Character Set Negotiation. You can find numerous online resources and tutorials on HTTP. 
- **Read:** Explore the concept of HTTP Cookies and how they function.

**Important Notes:**

- **Plagiarism:** Copying someone else's work is strictly prohibited. This project aims to solidify your understanding through independent learning.
- **Content Privacy:**  The content you create for this project should not be published anywhere.

**Getting Started:**

This project utilizes specific coding styles and editors. Make sure you're familiar with:

- Text editors: vi, vim, or emacs

**Project Requirements:**

- **README.md:**  A file named README.md is mandatory in your project directory. It should provide an overview of the project and its goals.
- **Script Length:** All Bash scripts should be concise and limited to 3 lines (verified using `wc -l`).
- **Newline Character:** Ensure all files conclude with a newline character.
- **Executable Files:** Make all your files executable using the `chmod +x filename` command.
- **Bash Script Format:**
    - Line 1: `#!/bin/bash` (specifies the interpreter)
    - Line 2: Comment explaining the script's purpose
    - Line 3: Script logic
- **cURL Commands:** Use the `-s` (silent mode) option with all cURL commands.
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8.5 will be used to execute Python files.
- **Python Code Style:** Adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines for code formatting.
- **Python Documentation:**
    - Module Documentation: Employ `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'` to display module documentation.
    - Class Documentation: Utilize `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'` to view class documentation.
    - Function Documentation: Leverage `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'` to access documentation for functions within and outside a class.
    - Docstring Length: Docstrings (explanations) should be descriptive, not just single words.
